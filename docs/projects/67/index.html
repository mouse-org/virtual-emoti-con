    <p>
      The Sanit-Safe is an enclosed disinfection equipment designed for killing microoganisms such as bacteria and viruses including coronavirus that may be delivered via mail and packages. The equipment is intended to reduce the potential transmission of coronavirus from contaminated mail or infected mail carriers to recipients of mail. Currently, there is no known available outdoor/indoor cabinet designed weather proof equipment that can disinfect and store mail and packages after disinfection using ultraviolet light. The equipment has the added benefit in that mail carriers can directly deposit mail or packages into the equipment handsfree without the recipient having to touch the mail until after disinfection. It provides a safety measure particularly for persons who are concerned that their underlying health conditions place them at serious risk for covid-19. <br><br>The Center for Disease Control (CDC) states that there is still alot that is unknown about covid-19 and how it spreads. CDC also states that while the virus is unlikely to spread from domestic and international mail or packages, it can survive a short period on surfaces. Also, CDC adds that it may be possible that people can get covid-19 by touching an object  that has virus on it and touching mouth, nose or eyes. The idea came about after hearing concerns of persons about risk of transmission from mail and CDC≈õ indication of potential risk. Many persons are desirous of going an extra step to reduce any chances of infection by mail or packages. This equipment accomplishes this by providing an ultraviolet light alternative to using dangerous disinfection chemicals to spray or wipe mail and packages that can get on a person hands or be inhaled. <br><br>The Sanit-safe is an environmentally safe alternative. It uses proven technology and various applications that are seen with NYC MTA using ultraviolet lamps to sanitize trains and buses. The application of ultraviolet light has been around for a long time, and design for domestic and commercial use is beginning to become popular. The Sanit-safe is primarily designed for residential home use. However, it can also be used for commercial application such as for offices receiving mail and packages. The equipment is designed as a weather proof fully enclosed metal cabinet with AC/DC power sources to power the lamps and technology. It is designed into two compartments. The top compartment has an foot operated open slot large enough for standard mail and packages. When mail or package is placed into the top compartment the open slot will seal shut, and the equipment automatically operated to provide a dose of ultraviolet ( i.e. ranging from 5.4 though 27mJ/cm2 )for a set period to kill or inhibit pathogens. Status of disinfection will be indicated with LED lights. <br><br>After disinfection is completed, the base of the top compartment will open and release the mail of package into the lower compartment, where it can be retrieved. The lower compartment will allow for a certain volume of storage and a LED indicator light will indicate when available or filled. Safety features will be built in, such as preventing mail from being accessed when equipment is operating, or when doors are open. Even without covid-19, the equipment is expected to be useful for general sanitation and exposure to pathogens.

            <p>Wow. Just Wow. This design is amazing and super relevant. Based off of your pitch, you clearly did research and are aware of current technologies and use cases that make great evidence and supports your effort. I think that systems and devices like these can have a great impact on the exposure rate over time and would absolutely love to see one of these prototyped and possibly pitched to post offices or other delivery services and/or areas that are densely packed. Your work is clear, the design is optimal and am super excited to know that you are working towards something like this. Amazing job!

Not going to lie, after seeing your project, I kept thinking about other ways in which something like this could be practical. Would absolutely love to hear other ways you see this being helpful beyond just disinfecting mail!</p>

            <p>Hi, Daniel! This is such a relevant idea! Does Amazon know about you? I like that you‚Äôre using credible sources to back up your claims and why your product is important. Using sources is a great way to boost your authority as a creator! 

I love that you‚Äôre already thinking about how a person would use this product. UX design could be a great career option, but you also could get into a type of engineering or product design if you want to create more physical things. 

Great work on creating a visual identity for Sanit Safe on your presentation. Blue is such a calming color (and calm is definitely the vibe you want this product to give off) and works really well for a product designed to impact health. I appreciate all the thought that went into your presentation‚Äîthe decision matrix in particular is really strong. 

What would you think about choosing a font that‚Äôs a little more elevated? When working on a healthcare product, you want your audience to trust you, and establishing a professional, safe, and clean font is one way to do that. I think you‚Äôre right to choose a Sans-Serif font so it doesn‚Äôt feel stuffy, but I think a more uniform version will take it to the next level! 

The visuals you have here are great. I like that I can easily picture what your product will look like and how it works. What happens if someone received a package that is too large for the box? Maybe down the line you can create a bigger option for mail rooms or entire apartment buildings instead of individuals. Let‚Äôs scale this! </p>

            <p>Thank you very much everyone for your words of encouragement and feedback. I really appreciate the time you took to provide me with some very good ideas to improve this project. I am researching the cost to build a prototype. However, this process is somewhat challenging. It is my goal to see this project become a reality and help make a difference to reduce the spread of diseases. I am working on some design improvements for this device. I hope that once it gets produced it is affordable for everyone. Thanks again for your feedback.</p>

            <p>Very relevant concept that has wide application for the sanitation of items. It seems very practical, and realistic in design and purpose. An actual prototype would be great to test which will indicate any modifications that would be necessary. This would be typical for any prototype. I can see a big demand for this product if manufactured and available for sale. I would be a customer. Nice job. </p>

            <p>Very timely innovation given the Covid-19 pandemic. The world will forever be more sensitive to the need to sanitize things like mail and parcels  received in  and from workplaces , post offices and in private life.  Postal  workers , delivery service,  ,sanitizing what they receive from members of the public. This can replace our postal boxes . Very brilliant  innovation, simple  design and useful.  It can be made in different sizes for commercial and domestic use.  I like the fact it can be ac/DC. It can be designed to accommodate  solar  energy  also.  I dont see this being too expensive  for one&#x27;s safety  and for society to invest in. If it&#x27;s not Covid -19 its other germs that can be killed.   I would definitely invest in this. </p>
