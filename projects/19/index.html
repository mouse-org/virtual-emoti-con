    </div>
    <p>
      Our game is a revolution to the disabled gaming world. People with disabilities were unable to play video games, as they might not have the dexterity to play them. Our main focus was to make an audio game, a video game that solely uses sounds or songs. We made a game ‚ÄúAuditory Action‚Äù using the coding language Scratch. We hope that the game will help expand the world of blind gamers, as part of the gamers with disabilities act.<br><br>Upon starting the game, you are greeted by a welcoming voice which tells you how to play. You must pass five levels to finish the game. If you get the level right the first time, you earn a point, and progress to the next level. If you get the level wrong the first time, you do not earn a point, but you do get a second chance. <br><br>This project took our team 3 weeks to complete. The development of the game was not easy as we ran into some problems. Some of the problems include not playing the sound, not playing the correct sound, and sounds overlapping others. To fix our problems, we extensively used variables. Later, we improved our game, such as making sound selection more accessible. Another early flaw was that you had to use your mouse to play it. This, of course, cannot be done easily for someone who cannot see when you need to move your mouse.<br><br>We carefully chose each sound choice to fit the level‚Äôs theme. We wanted to make the player recognise the sounds for the first two levels by using real sounds like an instrument or an animal noise. The next two levels are cartoony sounds to amuse the player. The last level is unique as it is not differentiating sounds per se, but differentiating tone.<br><br>Henceforth, our game is designed to pave the way for blind gamers. It is a proof of concept, that blind people can play video games, and they get just as much enjoyment as someone with their sight intact. It will help to include those with such issues, and they will cherish their wonderful experiences in the video game community.<br><br>

            <p>Wolfgang, Shohru, Yucheng, John-- very well done. I am so glad that you all chose to go with a game or concept that touches on the issue of accessibility. What I love most about your game is that I attempted to do it with my eyes closed and was reminded of just how much we take our abilities for granted. Your game made me think.

I believe that the concept for this game is phenomenal and left me wanting more! My biggest piece of feedback for you all is to definitely clarify the instructions a bit more! It took me a few turns to figure out how to play, but once I did - i was excited to reach the end! Great Work!</p>

              </h4>
            <p>Hi, Wolfgang, Shohru, Yucheng, and John! I‚Äôm amazed by the progress you were all able to make in three weeks and I love that it‚Äôs focused on increasing accessibility in gaming. Equity is important in every industry and your passion will carry you all so far!

I also want to commend you for discussing the issues you ran into when developing your game. With any project, there are always bugs along the way, and taking people through your process is guaranteed to increase their buy-in for what you‚Äôve created. People are receptive to vulnerability, and your willingness to admit that it wasn‚Äôt always easy is a huge advantage to you as individual contributors and leaders!

I think your presentation is really elevated. I love the color scheme and the fonts you chose. I‚Äôd love to see more visuals or audio throughout to accommodate more ability levels and learning styles. 

It‚Äôs really cool to see how you all collaborated on this project and who did what. At Fullstack Academy, we heavily teach pair programming in all our software engineering and cybersecurity courses. When you collaborate with others, you gain new ideas and perspectives! 

As far as playing the game goes, I like that option 1 (D or F) and option 2 (J or K) use letters that are right next to each other. That makes it so much easier. I also like that the instructions are clear and are the first thing you see. I didn‚Äôt realize initially how to start the game, but once I figured it out, it was super easy and fun! I‚Äôm excited to see what future levels look like. It could also be fun to build it out so Level 1 has you correctly identify 1 sound, Level 2, 2 sounds, and so on, or you could even stack them by 5s! Level 1, 5; Level 2, 10, something like that, so it increases in difficulty.</p>

            <p>This was a really creative game and a simple solution to a complicated problem.
