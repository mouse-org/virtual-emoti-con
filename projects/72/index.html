            <p>The presentation is very well done! The societal issue is clear and objective and the the facts are well laid out to support your mission statement.

            <p>Awesome concept and considerations for the communities in NYC which have many homeless people in need of support. Love how your team was inclusive here to call-out a major problem and a community that is more often than not misunderstood, misjudged, and underserved. The research that went into this project really shines – the presentation helps me, as a user, to truly understand where your intent lies. I believe that your team could focus on expanding on the game itself, incorporating more interactivity from the user, as well as be a stronger example of the implications of the homeless using their debit / credit card (maybe by showing what they could buy in the grocery store, showing how they might use it on the subway etc.). Overall, great ideas! Keep it going. :)</p>

            <p>Hey Joel, Tyrese, Keira, Makayla, and Abdoul,

Thanks for putting out your project for Emoti-con! I find it admirable that you all are making this project to help those most in need and most vulnerable - especially in a time like this.  All of your documentation is great - Your intro gives a clear sense of the problem, and the proposal for the system is detailed - providing processes for all kinds of scenarios. One of the most difficult part of designing these systems is avoiding scenarios in which the system can be abused. For example, we might want to prevent users from taking out cash (unsure if it was debit or credit) from ATMs. I do believe a system like this could help them - in particular if the card could nudge the user away from making poor decisions. If you enjoyed working on this project, I encourage looking into Poly Sci either online or in school

-Charlie</p>

            <p>I think the idea of helping homeless is people is really nice and thoughtful but giving them money isn’t the right way to help them, they might not know how to spend their money in a way but instead of giving them training to spend money right way, we can give them training of how to start their own business or way, where they are able to help themselves.</p>
