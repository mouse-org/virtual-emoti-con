            <p>I really enjoyed reading through your design process, it&#x27;s clear that a lot of thought was put into this and I am impressed at your collaborative effort. It would be interesting to add levels to the games perhaps it could speed up as you advance, as I felt it started off a bit fast.</p>

            <p>I love the fact that you all decided to use a ball as your main symbol for your game. When you typically think of playing outside, most often the first thing people think of is a ball. However, many people with limited movement are unable to play ball but your game gives them a chance to in a different way. A suggestion I would like to make is to go over your game once more because when the ball hits the green pad, the game flashes. This can be hard on the eyes and may even be very trying for people with issues like epilepsy. Otherwise, great job.</p>

            <p>Very nice work! It was grounded in research and well-crafted; the game supported the goal of helping people who have disabilities can also enjoy the game experience. It is an excellent example of design research, data collection, and behavioral analytics. I would like to recommend exploring a research program to learn more about quantitative/qualitative methods for design research. Great work!</p>
