    </div>
    <p>
      We are a diverse group of high school students from all over New York City who have come together to make a documentary film as a part of the Educational Video Center (EVC) community. We had begun pitching social issues to produce a documentary about when our in-person workshops were cancelled. We think that there is nothing more pressing and interesting than an issue that is affecting everyone around the world, so we decided to use documentary strategies to chronicle our experiences as youth through a blog. We are each very unique and have our own perspectives, but are focusing on showing the experiences of people on the front lines, including youth and low income, immigrant or black communities. The Quaranteens hope that the people who read this blog (watch this film) are able to see this very surreal experience through our eyes, and know that they‚Äôre not alone. We also think showcasing this work at Emoti-Con will help us gather submissions from other Quaranteens

            <p>I like the witty play on words. The design of the website was well executed. It felt like I was scrolling through a blog post on Medium. It was a good idea to place and option for likes, comments, and views. The ability to share on social media platform was a great add. You had your target audience in mind when creating this website. The content on the site is what melded everything together, it is what set the tone for the website. Keep working on it, I&#x27;m interested to see where it goes. </p>

            <p>Such a robust website! So many different media forms and ways for the viewer to experience the content. I think this is a great idea because some people prefer to read, others watch video, others look at still photos‚Äîyou covered them all. Another strength of this platform is depicting the life of teens as both a collective, and individual stories. The dated vlogs were my favorite to explore and listen to. I think the entires where a great length, also it was easy for me to just move onto the next entry. Well done! </p>

            <p>This project is really well executed and the diversity of thoughts and opinions expressed is the need of the hour. There is some interesting and valuable advise here so Id follow that. Another thing you might consider is reaching out to young influencers in the fields of health, education, sports, travel etc. This way you get more content for the project along with building a steady following! Keep in mind : this project has the potential of creating a nation-wide movement. And America needs one right now. Good luck! </p>

            <p>Thoroughly enjoyed going through all the articles, vlogs, artwork and mini-essays in Quaranteen. It provides a great slice-of-life view from teens on how they feel about the coronavirus pandemic and life under quarantine. Would have liked the main page to be more organized, perhaps by theme or month, to make it easier to see the earlier entries without having to constantly scroll down. It&#x27;s a great collection of works and well done! For the next step, consider keeping it going, figure out how to archive it so you can look at it in the future and share with other teens. Maybe you might want to submit some of the contents to other public archival project, like the ones run by the New York Historical Society or Museum of the City of New York.

            <p>I love that Quaranteens gives young people a place to express themselves creatively and connect with one another. The project reminds me of Rookie Magazine, which also consisted of teen submissions. This work seems especially important right now. In thinking about how the work could grow or have a larger impact, I wonder if there is a way to have teens collaborate. For example, one person is writing a short journal entry and then another person could create a drawing or work of art inspired by the writing. One of the exciting things about the website is the opportunity to share and connect and I think while we are all isolated there is potential to take the connecting aspect further. 
I also think that documenting this experience though the lens of young people will be extremely important in the future so this website could turn out to be an amazing archive, shedding light on the experience of the pandemic for folks in the future. </p>
