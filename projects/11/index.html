    </div>
    <p>
      I wanted to create a website for this project that was a way to improve life with the COVID-19 Pandemic and our way of life has changed for now and the future. With Health-club clubs to going bankrupt and gym members unable to workout, I realized that we need to create a way to find online home classes application that finds affordable options that is a win-win for the business and the customers. The challenge will be getting the clubs (as well as celebrity classes) to give us a discount to pass on to customers as long as a commission to our venture. You can access this site on a computer, laptop, iPad, or phone. I am trying to bring people together as a community and show them that there is more to life than staying home and doing nothing with these online classes like New Normal Fitness we can achieve something new.  The next step for New Normal Fitness that I would want to do is to make the website even better by putting pictures of other people&#x27;s experiences on my website.

            <p>Thank you for your submission. This reminds me of a digital class pass.

Additionally, perhaps in the future gyms or spaces could be rented out with equiptment, as the new gym normal.</p>

            <p>Hey Rebecca – awesome choice to create a website versus a game, as it makes sense as a proper avenue to reach your target audience! I think that it is very relevant to tackle the COVID-19 crisis our country is currently in, and even better to highlight the problem that many people are having which is staying in shape and healthy amidst health concerns at gyms. I would recommend adding links to each website on your own website to explore them further, as well as making it clear how I redeem the 50% off coupons. </p>

            <p>Dear Rebecca, with all that is going on in the world I&#x27;m glad you decided to help by making a website to give people access to fitness classes.

            <p>Hi Rebecca,

Thanks for submitting your website and business idea to Emoti-con! I think your idea is pretty cool. I reminds me of Group-on and other coupon book companies. I think that if a gym company were to hear about your idea, they would see it as an opportunity to expand their outreach to more potential customers. The bigger the outreach, the more the value it is to the gym. Getting the first few gyms on board would no doubt be the most difficult part. Though I&#x27;d imagine the first gyms might have a slightly different arrangement that&#x27;d make it easier for them to give a half-off membership. Something I think I&#x27;d like to see in a future iteration of the website is to give some clarification on what other perks a member would get.  I was unsure if the 1 on 1 and group classes were administered by NNF themselves or if they were offerings from another gym. Overall, I enjoyed looking at your site. If you have the time, I recommend taking a look into the world of advertising. All companies need to find a way to reach their customers - and your idea could be one of them.
